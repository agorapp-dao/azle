# The Azle Book

This book is intended to be an in-depth guide to [canister](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/concepts/canisters-code) development in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/) (IC).

The first 19 chapters are an introductory guide into canister development with [Azle](./azle.md). These chapters build on each other concept by concept, introducing the most fundamental knowledge required to build and deploy canisters to the IC.

Chapter 20 is an in-depth reference of the APIs available to Azle canisters.

Our intention is for developers entirely new to the IC to start at chapter 1 and work through to chapter 20, to be able to gain an excellent working knowledge of the fundamentals of IC canister development by the end.

Once that working knowledge is gained and you become proficient in canister development, the reference will be extremely useful for quickly retreiving specific APIs that you might need.

There is also a companion video series to The Azle Book on YouTube. Each chapter will begin with the video companion as soon as it is available.

You should expect this book and its companion video series to continue to grow and change over time, as its authors and the Internet Computer will continue growing and changing.
