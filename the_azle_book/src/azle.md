# Azle

Azle is a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) [Canister Development Kit](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/cdks/) (CDK) for the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/) (IC). It's essentially a TypeScript/JavaScript runtime that allows you to build applications (canisters) for the IC.

It is currently being developed by [Demergent Labs](https://github.com/demergent-labs), a for-profit company with a grant from [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org/).

Demergent Labs' [vision](https://github.com/demergent-labs/blog/blob/main/demergent-labs-grand-plan-part-1.md) is to accelerate the adoption of Web3, the Internet Computer, and sustainable open source.

## Why Choose Azle or Congratulations, Benefits, Stuff Like That?

A very common question for newcomers to the IC is which language to write their canisters in. Practically speaking based on CDK maturity, the following languages are available for canister development on the IC: Motoko, Python, TypeScript, and Rust.

The answer to this question for you will be multi-facted and somewhat subjective. A few simple answers for why you might choose TypeScript for your canister development:

-   TypeScript (JavaScript) is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
-   Many pre-existing libraries are available for immediate use with package managers/registries like `npm`
-   TypeScript (JavaScript) has existed for over 25 years
-   TypeScript has a huge community
-   Many existing tutorials, blog posts, podcasts, videos, etc
